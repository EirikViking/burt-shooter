Status: `ready_for_steam_upload_and_client_validation`

This packet proves local upload preflight only. It is not Steam-client validation evidence.

- ContentRoot: `..\\desktop\\win-unpacked`

- Write command: `STEAM_APP_ID=<id> STEAM_DEPOT_ID=<id> npm run steamworks:write-vdf`
- Upload command shape: `tools\\steamcmd\\steamcmd.exe +login <steamworks-user> +run_app_build release\\steamworks\\app_build_LOCAL.vdf +quit`

## Steam Client Validation Still Required

After real SteamPipe upload and Steam-client install, either copy `release/steamworks/client_validation_report.template.json` to `release/steamworks/client_validation_report.json` manually or run:

`STEAM_CLIENT_VALIDATION_CONFIRM=I_REVIEWED_STEAM_CLIENT_BUILD STEAM_CLIENT_ALL_CHECKS_PASSED=YES STEAM_BUILD_ID=<steam build id> STEAM_VALIDATED_BY=<name> STEAM_INSTALL_PATH=<steam install path> STEAM_SCREENSHOT_EVIDENCE=<screenshot path> npm run steamworks:write-client-validation`

Only use that command after testing the Steam-installed build.
